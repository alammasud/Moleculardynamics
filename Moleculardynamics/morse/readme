input file has the following format
500 //number of steps
6 //number of duplicate along x
6 //number of duplicate along y
6 //number of duplicate along z
4 //number of atom in unit cell
4.086e-10 //lattice parameter
1.7909e-25 //mass of one atom
300.0 //temperature
1e-15//time step 
3.13e-10 //force cutoff
5.2118e-20 //potential depth
1.3535e10 //potential expotnetials sclaing paramter alpha
50 //save strcutre after this many steps
//this code implement NVE ensmeble using Morse  potentials for FCC Ag
as refererenced in Phy.ReV B 157(3),1967
to run the code
type
..............
make clean
make all
./main
............
two files will be created 
1) datates.txt -> save the strcutre in lammps dump file format
2) energy.txt ->save energy , first column time step, second column potentials energy, third column kinetic energy, fourth column total energy
