input file has the following format
500 //number of steps
6 //number of duplicate along x
6 //number of duplicate along y
6 //number of duplicate along z
4 //number of atom in unit cell
3.6e-10 //lattice parameter
105.5206e-27 //mass of one atom
300.0 //temperature
1e-15//time step 
2.5487e-10 //force cutoff
3401.1 //epsilon
50 //output will be save every 50 time step
5 //m value 
8 //n value
//this code implement NVE ensmeble using m-n Lennard Jones potentials for FCC Cu
as refererenced in Phys.Stat.Sold (a) 78,595 (1983)
to run the code
type
..............
make clean
make all
./main
............
two files will be created 
1) datates.txt -> save the strcutre in lammps dump file format
2) energy.txt ->save energy , first column time step, second column potentials energy, third column kinetic energy, fourth column total energy
